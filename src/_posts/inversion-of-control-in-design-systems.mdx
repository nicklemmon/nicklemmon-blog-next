## The promise of design systems

UI component libraries and design systems enable brand consistency at scale. By
leveraging a design system, large organizations can ship consistently branded
digital experiences without the need to re-build repetitive UI elements across
multiple applications simultaneously.

Designers may view a component library as a means of establishing visual control
over disparate teams and processes, narrowing the range of possibilities that
can be produced across a large digital footprint.

For example, the component may include some opinions about where icons can be
placed. In our initial draft, we built a button component that accepts an `icon`
prop:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@company/ui'

function MyApp() {
  return <Button icon="plus-circle">Click me</Button>
}
```

> Designers may view a component library as a means of establishing visual
> control over disparate teams and processes, narrowing the range of
> possibilities that can be produced across a large digital footprint.

Ta-dah! In this example, the `Button` handles the icon via a unique identifier,
rendering it on the right hand side of the element only. Now we can _require_
teams within our company to only position icons on the right and make sure we
keep our buttons visually consistent across applications.

## Uh oh

Unfortunately, we immediately get a request to support icons on the left &mdash;
and the requesting team has a very strong argument for doing so that we never
could have anticipated when we first started. How can we handle this without
publishing a breaking change to our component? Maybe the better original
component API would have looked something like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@company/ui'

function MyApp() {
  // `iconPosition` can be "right" or "left", defaulting to "right" when nothing is set
  return (
    <Button icon="plus-circle" iconPosition="left">
      Click me
    </Button>
  )
}
```

Ta-dah! We did it. Now we have solved our problem and we can ride in to the
sunset truly and confidently victorious. We do have two separate props that are
tightly coupled, but at least they both start with the name `icon` so that
shouldn't be too painful...

## Uh oh (not again)

Once again we receive a request from a team building an application &mdash; and
they really need **two icons at once**, one icon on each side _simultaneously_.
Well, this will be difficult to support with our existing component API but
let's roll our sleeves and give it a shot.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@company/ui'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* We still need to support our old API, so let's leave this as an example of what that looks like */}
      <Button icon="plus-circle" iconPosition="left">
        Click me
      </Button>
      {/* We can also support this newer approach (definitely bulletproof this time!) */}
      <Button rightIcon="plus-circle" leftIcon="checkmark">
        Click me
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

I'm not sure what would happen if an engineer tried to use `iconPosition` and
`leftIcon` at the same time, but surely no one would do something so foolish,
right?

## It won't stop

After declaring victory, we ride in to the sunset. At least until another team
requests our help with the `Button` component. This time they aren't too
concerned with `iconPosition`, but they do want to change the color of the icon
somehow &mdash; and ideally they could use a design token to do so.

Well, that shouldn't be too hard (though we do have to support all of our
existing component API surface when we make this change):

```tsx
import { Button } from '@company/ui'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* Well, `iconColor` will work here but we definitely can't have two different colors at once */}
      <Button icon="plus-circle" iconPosition="left" iconColor="fg.action">
        Click me
      </Button>
      {/* Aha! We *can* support two different colors with this API though */}
      <Button
        rightIcon="plus-circle"
        leftIcon="checkmark"
        rightIconColor="fg.action"
        leftIconColor="fg.success"
      >
        Click me
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

Well, we made the consuming team happy but this is getting really gnarly and
hard to maintain. In order to support icons in two positions, each with distinct
imagery and color, we now have _7 props we need to maintain_ &mdash; and nearly
all of them are tightly coupled with one another, meaning each time we need to
change 1 we put the other 6 at risk of a break. Not good.

Not to mention, the design team's goal of controlling the visual positioning of
icons within buttons has now been lost. Now we have lost consistency _and_ we
have a highly complex component simultaneously. What a mess.

What started with good intentions (control over design) has quickly devolved in
to a mess for the engineering team, all without any material benefit to the
designers.

## Enter component composition and inversion of control

Looking from the end result, it's easy to see how a component API like this can
naturally evolve over time and end in a unenviable place. A rather simple
component that accepts an icon is now extremely complex and brittle to maintain
&mdash; if we could hop in a time machine here, how could we handle this better?

Instead of using string props, it's time to use `children` to make the component
surface area much smaller while keeping everyone happy (especially the design
system engineering team):

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonIcon } from '@company/ui'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* To reposition the icon, we just put it first in the DOM order just like regular HTML */}
      <Button>
        <ButtonIcon icon="plus-circled" />
        Click me
      </Button>
      {/* And here is the same icon on the right */}
      <Button>
        Click me
        <ButtonIcon icon="plus-circled" />
      </Button>
      {/* And now one icon on each side */}
      <Button>
        <ButtonIcon icon="success" />
        Click me
        <ButtonIcon icon="plus-circled" />
      </Button>
      {/* And now each icon has its own color */}
      <Button>
        <ButtonIcon icon="success" color="fg.success" />
        Click me
        <ButtonIcon icon="plus-circled" color="fg.action" />
      </Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

Success! We have accomplished a few things with this approach:

1. We have decoupled props &mdash; the `ButtonIcon` component has its own props
   that control its appearance, but they are distinct from the parent `Button`
2. Teams can implement icons in whichever order they choose in an
   easy-to-understand way, no component API documentation required
3. The `Button` component is much less likely to break accidentally when its
   internal structure changes compared to the old approach
4. Teams can even use conditional logic within a button instance more easily,
   using JSX to conditionally add and remove icons based on conditions relevant
   to their users

### Empowerment over control

By empowering application teams to understand the needs of their users, design
system teams can build components with a much better developer experience all
while reducing the risk of regression defects in the future. Teams may build
wild and crazy things using their newfound power of component composition
&mdash; and at the end of the day that's OK. Application teams are _almost
always closer to their users and the needs of the business_ and giving
application teams the keys to their own destiny is the only way to effectively
build a design system at scale
