When building a web site or application with accessibility in mind, laundry
lists of rules and requirements come to mind. This often leads organizations to
adopt [accessibility checklists](http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/) that
hopefully provide designers and engineers with a concrete series of requirements
that all products must meet.

Despite their complexity, nearly all of these requirements start with a
foundation in semantically valid HTML. Though this may sound like a low bar to
meet, many engineers struggle to write semantically valid markup, particluarly
when those engineers may have more expertise in pure programming rather than the
ins-and-outs of HTML.

## Abstractions Upon Abstractions

When building for the web using modern JavaScript frameworks, oftentimes the
actual DOM that is being rendered to the page is abstracted away via several
layers of custom components. These abstractions are great on the surface - they
allow for code re-use, visual consistency, and UX consistency. Unfortunately,
custom components can also cause engineers to lose the forest for the trees, and
ignore the final, rendered markup with which end users interact.

Take this JSX that renders a page with a data table of recipes:

```jsx
export function MyRecipesPage() {
  <Page title="My Recipes">
    <SortableTable data={recipes}>
    <Button to="/">Go Back</Button>
  </Page>
}
```

Looks great! The page works as expected and the code is easy to read thanks to
component abstractions. But how can an engineer have confidence that these
components are rendering valid markup? What if that `<Button>` component is
incorrectly rendering an HTML button instead of an anchor tag? What if
`<SortableTable />` is just a series of `div` and `span` tags rather than a
semantically meaningful data table?

## Automated Testing

Ideally, a layer of automated testing at the component level would catch these
problems, while also encouraging engineers to choose components available to
them that render semantically valid markup.

### Enzyme Shallow Mounting

For years in the React community, testing a page component like this would
probably start with using [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/), a
library with utilities for testing React components in a Node-based virtual DOM
environment like [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#readme). One would
probably start with something like this using Enzyme's `shallow` method:

```js
describe('MyRecipesPage', () => {
  it('renders a Page with a title', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<MyRecipesPage />)
    const page = wrapper.find('Page')

    expect(page).toExist()
    expect(page).toHaveProp('title', 'My Recipes')
  })

  it('renders a SortableTable with recipes data', () => {
    const mockRecipes = []
    const wrapper = shallow(<MyRecipesPage recipes={mockRecipes} />)
    const table = wrapper.find('SortableTable')

    expect(table).toExist()
    expect(table).toHaveProp('data', mockRecipes)
  })

  it('renders a Button that returns the user to the landing page', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<MyRecipesPage recipes={mockRecipes} />)
    const button = wrapper.find('Button')

    expect(button).toExist()
    expect(button).toHaveProp('to', '/')
  })
})
```

These tests look like they are verifying the rendered output - but all they are
doing is verifying that the components used in the page component were actually
returned. Do these tests provide future engineers with confidence in the final
rendered DOM? Assuming future engineers were interested in testing the HTML
semantics of the page, they might be concerned with answering the following
questions:

- Does `<MyRecipesPage />` have a valid heading?
- Is the data rendered in a valid HTML table?
- Does the button actually render as a link or does it (incorrectly) render as
  an HTML button?

### Cypress to the Rescue

Refactoring these tests with [Cypress](https://cypress.io) can help address some
of these concerns:

```js
describe('"My Recipes" page', () => {
  beforeEach(() => cy.visit('/recipes'))

  it('renders with a relevant page title', () => {
    cy.title().should('include', 'My Recipes Page') // Checking for a unique <title />
    cy.get('h1').should('be.visible').should('contain', 'My Recipes Page')
  })

  it('renders with a table that contains recipe data', () => {
    cy.get('table').should('be.visible')
    // Verify data renders as expected
    cy.get('tbody tr').eq(0).should('contain', 'Chicken Pot Pie')
    cy.get('tbody tr').eq(1).should('contain', 'Green Curry')
  })

  it('renders with a link to go back to the home page', () => {
    cy.get('a')
      .should('be.visible')
      .should('contain', 'Go Back')
      .should('have.attr', 'href', '/')
  })
})
```

Great! Now these tests run in the browser _and_ are grabbing elements from the
DOM instead of React component abstractions that may or may not be producing the
markup we are expecting.

These tests can be taken a step further using
[Cypress Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/cypress).

#### Cypress Testing Library

Cypress Testing Library offers a series of methods to help query elements more
granularly, allowing room for code refactors as well as the addition of new
features to the page. If the page were to introduce an additional link, for
example, the prior test checking for the home page anchor tag would fail:

```jsx
export function MyRecipesPage() {
  <Page title="My Recipes">
    <SortableTable data={recipes}>
    <Button to="/">Go Back</Button>
    <Button to="https://google.com">Find More Recipes</Button>
  </Page>
}
```

And now this test would need to changed:

```js
it('renders with a link to go back to the home page', () => {
  // This test was broken by the introduction of another anchor tag!
  // Not ideal since the original "Go Back" link continued to work as expected.
  cy.get('a')
    .eq(0)
    .should('be.visible')
    .should('contain', 'Go Back')
    .should('have.attr', 'href', '/')

  cy.get('a')
    .eq(1)
    .should('be.visible')
    .should('contain', 'Find More Recipes')
    .should('have.attr', 'href', 'https://google.com')
})
```

Instead of grabbing raw HTML elements, the `cy.findByRole` method (made
available via Cypress Testing Library) can be used to check for valid,
accessible DOM output all while reducing the risk of test brittleness:

```js
describe('"My Recipes" page', () => {
  beforeEach(() => cy.visit('/recipes'))

  it('renders with a relevant page title', () => {
    cy.title().should('include', 'My Recipes Page')
    // Using the `name` option helps grab the relevant heading that contains the content we are looking for
    cy.findByRole('heading', { name: 'My Recipes Page' }).should('be.visible')
  })

  it('renders with a table that contains recipe data', () => {
    cy.findByRole('table').within(() => {
      cy.get('tbody').within(() => {
        cy.findAllByRole('row').eq(0).should('contain', 'Chicken Pot Pie')
        cy.findAllByRole('row').eq(1).should('contain', 'Green Curry')
      })
    })
  })

  it('renders with a link to go back to the home page', () => {
    // This test will not be as brittle - it will find a link that has this content
    // no matter how many links are added to the page.
    cy.findByRole('link', { name: 'Go Back' }).should('have.attr', 'href', '/')
    cy.findByRole('link', { name: 'Find More Recipes' }).should(
      'have.attr',
      'href',
      'https://google.com'
    )
  })
})
```

So Cypress Testing Library helped solve three key problems with testing the
recipes page UI:

1. The tests are much less brittle now that they no longer rely on the order of
   DOM elements (nor will they break when new elements are introduced to the
   page)
2. The tests are able to handle valid HTML semantics whether they are derived
   from native HTML tags _or_ valid
   [ARIA roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques)
3. When future engineers work on this page, it will be more difficult to
   introduce invalid HTML even if such a bug were introduced via a higher level
   abstraction

An engineering team that leans heavily on `cy.findByRole` as their primary means
of querying elements in their tests will also catch accessibility problems
earlier. If an element is tough to query via `cy.findByRole`, that probably
means that a screen reader user (or even search engine crawler) would have
trouble interpreting the page as well and is an early indication that an
accessibility bug is present.

### Wrapping Up

Moving away from testing higher level abstractions with tools like
[Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) helps protect against the
introduction of invalid markup. By leveraging [Cypress](https://cypress.io) and
[Cypress Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library)
(particluarly the `cy.findByRole` method) engineers can make automated testing
less brittle _and_ ensure their markup is meeting accessibility requirements all
within a real browser environment.
