[Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) in TypeScript
are a language feature that should generally be avoided &mdash; instead, use
string unions for most use cases. Ultimately, string unions are simpler to both
use and implement, allowing for end-to-end type safety without sacrificing
developer experience.

Often used for things like prop types or function parameters, an enum can be
used to define a union of possible acceptable values.

```tsx
enum Variant {
  Primary = 'primary',
  Secondary = 'secondary',
  Destructive = 'destructive',
}

function MyButton({ variant }: { variant: Variant }) {
  let className

  if (variant === Variant.Primary) {
    className = 'primary-btn'
  }

  if (variant === Variant.Secondary) {
    className = 'secondary-btn'
  }

  if (variant === Variant.Destructive) {
    className = 'destructive-btn'
  }

  return <button className={className}>Click me</button>
}
```

In this (fairly contrived) example, the enum is used to determine which CSS
class should be applied to the button. This solution works for defining several
valid variants (and excluding all others), but it offers worse developer
ergonomics over time than alternative approaches.

## Enum problems

### 1. Enums do not exist in JavaScript at runtime

By the time TypeScript compiles, the JavaScript engine running your program no
longer has a reference to the enum in a true 1 to 1 sense. As a result,
[an enum becomes an object at runtime](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#enums-at-runtime).
This isn't necessarily a _problem_ but it can be confusing, particularly to
developers who may not be aware that all constructs in TypeScript do not map
one-to-one to JavaScript constructs.

Enums
[can have surprising differences](https://www.totaltypescript.com/why-i-dont-like-typescript-enums)
once compiled to JavaScript!

### 2. Enums add to bundle size

Because an `enum` must be imported and used as a value, it must be available at
runtime, adding to overall bundle size once compiled.

```ts
// This creates `VariantEnum` at runtime
enum Variant {
  Primary = 'primary',
  Secondary = 'secondary',
  Destructive = 'destructive',
}
```

```ts
// This is not available at runtime at all
type Variant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive'
```

### 3. More boilerplate when passing enums to functions/components

When we use an enum to strictly type a function (or component props), developers
have to import that enum in order to use it when invoking the function (or
component), adding additional overhead that isn't required when using string
unions.

To take the previous example, let's use our `MyButton` component and pass a
variant:

```tsx
import { Variant, MyButton } from './my-button.tsx'

function MyPage() {
  return <MyButton variant={Variant.Primary} />
}
```

This is relatively painless in a React application, but when used in an Angular
component, things get a little unusual

#### Angular component props and enums

In this example, we define our `enum` (just like in the React `MyButton`
component) but there is a _lot_ more boilerplate required to implement the end
result.

```ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core'
import { NgClass } from '@angular/common'

enum Variant {
  Primary = 'primary',
  Secondary = 'secondary',
  Destructive = 'destructive',
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-button',
  imports: [NgClass],
  template: `
    <button
      [ngClass]="{
        primary: this.variant === this.Variant.Primary,
        secondary: this.variant === this.Variant.Secondary,
        destructive: this.variant === this.Variant.Destructive,
      }"
    >
      Click me
    </button>
  `,
})
export class MyButton {
  public Variant = Variant

  @Input()
  variant?: Variant
}
```

This works fairly cleanly when defining the component, though we do have to
expose the `Variant` enum has a public member of the `MyButton` class in order
to use it. Not only that, but we have to import and expose the `Variant` in each
component class that uses the button `variant` prop! That is a _lot_ of code to
pass a string.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { MyButton, Variant } from './my-button'

@Component({
  selector: 'my-page',
  imports: [MyButton],
  template: `<my-button [variant]="this.Variant.Primary"></my-button>`,
})
export class MyPage {
  // ðŸ˜¥ exposing this to access it in the template
  public Variant = Variant
}
```

Not to mention, now the `MyPage` class exposes a public `Variant` that can be
accessed programmatically &mdash; and without a significant benefit since our
intention was only to leverage the value in the component template.

## String unions as an alternative

For most enum use cases, use string unions instead. This simplifies both our
prior React and Angular button examples substantially.

### React example

First, the button component.

```tsx
type Variant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive'

// We can do a nice little look up here with each object key
// strictly typed to be a valid `Variant`
const VARIANT_CLASS_MAP: Record<Variant, string> = {
  primary: 'primary-btn',
  secondary: 'secondary-btn',
  destructive: 'destructive-btn',
}

function Button({ variant }: { variant: Variant }) {
  return <button className={VARIANT_CLASS_MAP[variant]}>Click me</button>
}
```

And now its usage.

```tsx
import { Button } from './my-button'

function MyPage() {
  // No need to import `Variant` at all!
  // *And* TypeScript will still throw an error at build time with an invalid value
  return <Button variant="primary" />
}
```

### Angular example

First, the button component.

```ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core'
import { NgClass } from '@angular/common'

type Variant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive'

@Component({
  selector: 'my-button',
  imports: [NgClass],
  template: `
    <button
      [ngClass]="{
        primary: this.variant === 'primary',
        secondary: this.variant === 'secondary',
        destructive: this.variant === 'destructive',
      }"
    >
      Click me
    </button>
  `,
})
export class MyButton {
  @Input()
  variant?: Variant
}
```

And now its usage:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { MyButton } from './my-button'

@Component({
  selector: 'my-page',
  imports: [MyButton],
  template: `<my-button variant="primary"></my-button>`,
})
export class MyPage {}
```

### String unions at runtime

At times, string union values need to be made available at runtime. To achieve
this (and avoid repetition), define the string union values in a constant array
and derive the `type` from said array.

```ts
const VARIANTS = ['primary', 'secondary', 'destructive'] as const

type Variant = (typeof VARIANTS)[number]
```

It then becomes trivial to write a type guard function if needed using the same
constant array.

```ts
function isVariant(arg: any): arg is Variant {
  return VARIANTS.includes(arg)
}
```

### When you just can't quite enumerating

If you still insist on using enums (or need to refactor an existing codebase
that uses enums heavily), consider defining the enum `as const` which can help
avoid some of the aforementioned problems outlined in this article.

## Conclusion

String unions are capable alternatives to TypeScript enums in most scenarios,
and enable improved developer ergonomics and simplified implementation
particularly when defining function parameters or component props (especially
Angular component props!). While enums still _can_ be used, string unions should
be used in their place in most circumstances.
