Web components allow engineers to author re-usable, custom HTML elements which
can be used across platforms and frameworks. With a web component, an engineer
can build a custom component once, and re-use it within a React project, an
Angular project, or even a Ruby on Rails project.

I've written about
[implementing a collapsible component accessibly](/building-an-accessible-collapsible-element)
with vanilla HTML, so let's dive in with implementing this component using
[Lit](https://lit.dev).

## A simple example

For starters, let's take a look at a non-compound collapsible element:

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/blogbuilding-a-compound-web-component-with-lit-01?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/my-collapsible.ts&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1&theme=dark"></iframe>

In this example, a single component controls the state of the element as well as
passed-in content. A `title` prop is used to handle the content of the
triggering element. Everything works! We can use our component like any other
HTML element, and it works as expected:

```html
<my-collapsible title="My Collapsible Element">
  <p>This content will show and hide dynamically</p>
</my-collapsible>
```

After patting ourselves on the back, we quickly receive a request for a new
feature - an implementing team now wants to add a custom icon inside the
triggering button. OK, that should be easy enough - we can just add a
`title-icon` prop:

```html
<my-collapsible
  title="My Collapsible Element"
  title-icon="<svg id='some-inline-svg'></svg>"
>
  <p>This content will show and hide dynamically</p>
</my-collapsible>
```

Nice! This solves our problem. Except, what do we do if an implementing team
wants to use a `.png` as an icon? Or maybe they want to pass in a custom web
component instead of an inline SVG? And what if they want to put the icon on
either side of the triggering element content? Or maybe they want to apply a
color to that particular icon instance? We could quickly end up creating a
component with a lot of hard-to-manage surface area:

```html
<!-- some call this the apropcaplypse -->
<my-collapsible
  title="My Collapsible Element"
  title-icon=""
  title-icon-image="/path/to/icon.png"
  title-icon-color="hotpink"
  icon-position="left"
>
  <p>This content will show and hide dynamically</p>
</my-collapsible>
```

## Slots to the rescue

Fortunately for us, the
[slot element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot)
allows us to expose multiple places within our component in which to render
child content, including arbitrary HTML or custom elements:

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/blogbuilding-a-compound-web-component-with-lit-02?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/my-collapsible.ts&hideExplorer=1"></iframe>

We have removed the `title` prop entirely, and have no need for any of the
icon-related props either, as an implementing team can slot in whatever content
they want via the `"title"` slot.

```html
<my-collapsible>
  <h2 slot="title">
    Click Me
    <svg id="this-is-my-inline-svg">...</svg>
  </h2>
  <p slot="content">This content will show and hide dynamically</p>
</my-collapsible>
```

### Wrapping Up

In this example, we implemented a simple, accessible collapsible custom element
using [Lit](https://lit.dev). By leveraging slots over props, we were able to
dramatically simplify the component API, reducing our maintenance overhead as
well as the risk of defects.

In a future post, I'll discuss a more complex pattern that can offer even more
control to implementing teams, all while maintaining a simple component API
using the
[compound component](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks)
pattern.
