## Avoid flake, mock the backend

When automating application testing, managing the state of the backend in a
manner that is consistent and avoids flakiness is exceptionally difficult. To
address this problem, decoupled frontend user interfaces are often tested with a
mocked backend, intercepting HTTP requests in the browser and replacing their
responses with mock data.

- See [fixtures using Cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture)
- See [API mocking using Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/mock)

For the sake of simplicity, the rest of the examples in this post will use
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). This is the end result we will be
building towards &mdash; a rendered UI that fetches data from a mocked API
response:

```ts
import { test, expect, chromium } from '@playwright/test'
import { generateMock } from '@anatine/zod-mock'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { AccountSchema } from '../src/api'

const mockAccountList = generateMock(z.array(AccountSchema), { seed: 123 })

test('it shows accounts', async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 200 })
  const context = await browser.newContext()
  const page = await context.newPage()

  // Mock the accounts API
  await page.route(
    'https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list',
    async (route) => await route.fulfill({ json: mockAccountList })
  )

  // Visit the accounts page
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173')

  // Validate the rendered result
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Accounts' })).toBeVisible()
  await expect(page.getByText('Jane Turcotte / 471649368545782')).toBeVisible()
})
```

## Validating the backend

First, let's author some Zod schemas to validate the JSON response that will be
received from the backend. This example is directly from the prior article in
the series,
[‚ÄúNo more &lsquo;Trust me, bro&rsquo; data fetching in TypeScript applications‚Äù](/post/no-more-trust-me-bro-data-fetching).

Let's say that our `/accounts/list` endpoint returns a list of accounts. We can
validate that data at runtime using a library like `zod` to double check its
shape, and handle errors if an unexpected response is returned:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

// üëá this is our schema defined with Zod (available at runtime)
const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  holdings: z.number(),
})

// üëá this is our type definition inferred from the Zod schema (available at build time)
type Account = z.infer<typeof AccountSchema>

export async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  try {
    if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

    const json = z.array(AccountSchema).parse(await res.json())

    return json
  } catch (err) {
    throw Error(String(err))
  }
}
```

With our Zod schema defined, we can avoid a large category of type errors at
runtime, or at the very least, be well equipped to monitor our application for
data consistency errors.

## Building a UI

In this example, we will use our `listAccounts` function to fetch data in a
frontend single page application. Let's take a look at how this would work in a
React application (and use some of their newer features while we're at it). In
this example,
[@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start).

```tsx
import {
  useQuery,
  useQueryClient,
  QueryClient,
  QueryClientProvider,
} from '@tanstack/react-query'
// üëá Here, we import our `listAccounts` function with baked-in zod validation
import { listAccounts, type Account } from './api'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* Normally a router would be used here, but for the sake of simplicity we are using a component */}
      <AccountsPage />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}

function AccountsPage() {
  // üëá Our query fetches (and caches) the data as soon as the component mounts
  // Note that generics are used here to help with type inference. Since the `Account`
  // type definition is directly derived from our Zod schema, this is considered safe
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery<Array<Account>>({
    queryKey: ['accounts'],
    queryFn: listAccounts,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My accounts</h1>

      {isLoading ? (
        <div>Loading...</div>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {data?.map((account) => {
            return (
              <li key={account.id}>
                {account.name} / {account.holdings}
              </li>
            )
          })}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Mocking the backend

Our UI is built, our data is fetching, now we want to mock the data. Since we
have already used zod to validate our API response, we can _automatically create
mock test data using our zod schema_!

First, let's install
[@anatine/zod-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anatine/zod-mock) to create
fake test data generated directly from our Zod schemas:

```bash
npm i @anatine/zod-mock -D -E
```

We can then derive mock data from our schema in our test case without having to
manually author mocks. This allows mocks and source code to always stay in sync
&mdash; when our schemas change, our mocks update seamlessly.

```ts
import { test, expect, chromium } from '@playwright/test'
import { generateMock } from '@anatine/zod-mock'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { AccountSchema } from '../src/api'

// Generate mock account list from our zod schema
// Note we are using a seed here to force the account list to remain consistent for every test run and make sure it is deterministic,
// otherwise the test case will fail as the mock data will change each time the test runs
const mockAccountList = generateMock(z.array(AccountSchema), { seed: 123 })

test('it shows accounts', async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 200 })
  const context = await browser.newContext()
  const page = await context.newPage()

  // Mock the accounts API
  await page.route(
    'https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list',
    async (route) => await route.fulfill({ json: mockAccountList })
  )

  // Visit the accounts page
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173')

  // Validate the rendered result
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Accounts' })).toBeVisible()
  await expect(page.getByText('Jane Turcotte / 471649368545782')).toBeVisible()
})
```

## Putting it all together

Take a look at the
[GitHub repo showing this example](https://github.com/nicklemmon/blog-type-safe-data-mocking),
install the dependencies, and run the tests. The test cases launch and mock the
accounts API, showing generated data in its place.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicklemmon/blog-type-safe-data-mocking.git
cd blog-type-safe-data-mocking
npm run dev &
npx wait-on http://localhost:5173
npm run test
```
