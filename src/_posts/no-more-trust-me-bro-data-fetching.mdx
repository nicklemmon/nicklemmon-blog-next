TypeScript can help prevent a whole category of software defects, ensuring data
flows smoothly and predictably throughout an application &mdash; I have no idea
how I built applications without it in the past. When used insufficiently,
however, TypeScript does not offer this protection &mdash; rather, application
teams need to invest in adequate type safety, particularly when fetching data
&mdash; all while avoiding the temptation to tell the TypeScript compiler,
"trust me, bro."

## ‚ÄúTrust me, bro‚Äù data fetching

When fetching data, the JSON response is never typed by default, as the inferred
type of a typical fetching function is `Promise<any>`:

```ts
async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

  return await res.json() // üëà The inferred return type is `Promise<any>`
}
```

In typical applications, this problem is addressed via a type assertion using
`as`. When using `as` in this scenario, this is a "trust me, bro" moment. The
developer is telling the TypeScript compiler to not worry about the shape of the
response &mdash; "Trust me, bro," the shape is _always exactly what I say it
is_. No need to check yourself, TypeScript!

```ts
type Account = {
  id: string
  name: string
  holdings: number
}

async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

  // Here is the type assertion üëá
  // "Trust me, bro! The response is definitely an array of accounts."
  return (await res.json()) as Array<Account>
}
```

At this point, the data you receive could come in _any_ shape, and by using
`as`, we have simply turned off any adequate protection that TypeScript might
provide when it comes to the shape of the data flowing throughout our
application.

Even fully fledged, popular frontend frameworks (like Angular), who expose a
service for data fetching (see the
[HttpClient documentation for more](https://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data)),
still handle data typing via the "trust me, bro" strategy out of the box. In
this case, a generic is used instead of a type assertion, but the end result is
the same.

```ts
// This isn't using `as`, but a generic - the end result is the same - the shape of the data is not validated at runtime but is assumed!
// "Trust me, bro! The account list is *always* in the right shape!"
http.get<Array<Account>>('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')
```

Unfortunately, this leaves a lot to be desired. If the shape of the API response
ever changes unexpectedly _or_ if the type definition of `Account` is
inaccurate, any application logic that assumes the return type of
`listAccounts()` is `Array<Account>` can _never_ be completely trusted. Even
though TypeScript is used in the data fetching function, runtime errors can and
will occur unpredictably over time.

## Actually type safe (and predictable) data fetching

Instead of blindly assuming that your data is shaped in a certain way, it is
best to first validate that data at runtime, typically using a schema validation
library like [zod](https://zod.dev/) or [valibot](https://valibot.dev/).

Let's re-write our `listAccounts` function to validate the shape of the response
using `zod`:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

// This feels similar to TypeScript, but available at runtime
const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  holdings: z.number(),
})

async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  try {
    if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

    // We `.parse` the awaited JSON response to ensure its in the right shape,
    // and catch any errors that might result. With a monitoring service in place,
    // we could flag type runtime errors more cleanly for fixing by API teams.
    const json = AccountSchema.parse(await res.json())

    return json // The inferred return type will match the shape of the `AccountSchema`
  } catch (err) {
    throw Error(String(err))
  }
}
```

The `AccountSchema` looks awfully similar to TypeScript, but with a few extra
lines we can have both a schema definition which can handle validation at
runtime _and_ a type definition at build time which are inherently linked:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

// Runtime schema
const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  holdings: z.number(),
})

// Build time type definition
type Account = z.infer<typeof AccountSchema>
```

Now we can have type safe data fetching with type definitions _and_ runtime type
validation &mdash; all of which are tightly coupled to produce predictable
results.

## Schema and type usage in the UI layer

Now that we have a defined type, our UI can fetch data, and then render the
result predictably. The following example uses
[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) and React to help
orchestrate fetching and rendering.

First, we define our route. We can import our `listAccounts` function and use it
in the route definition:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { listAccounts } from '../api'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/accounts/$list')({
  component: RouteComponent,
  loader: async () => {
    // Remember, this function validates the shape of the data
    // or throws an error if the data is in an unexpected shape
    return await listAccounts()
  },
})

function RouteComponent() {
  // The account list is made available through the baked-in `useLoaderData` hook
  const accountList = Route.useLoaderData()

  return <h1>List of accounts</h1>
}
```

We can define an `<AccountListTable />` component, which expects an
`accountList` as a prop:

```tsx
import type { Account } from '../api'

function AccountListTable({ accountList }: { accountList: Array<Account> }) {
  return (
    <table>{/* Logic for rendering the account list table goes here */}</table>
  )
}
```

We can then render the `<AccountListTable />` in our accounts list route,
achieving end-to-end type safety, without relying to "trust me, bro" TypeScript
techniques:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { listAccounts } from '../api.ts'
import { AccountListTable } from '../account-list-table.tsx'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/accounts/$list')({
  component: RouteComponent,
  loader: async () => {
    // Remember, this function validates the shape of the data
    // or throws an error if the data is in an unexpected shape
    return await listAccounts()
  },
})

function RouteComponent() {
  // The account list is made available through the baked-in `useLoaderData` hook
  const accountList = Route.useLoaderData()

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>List of accounts</h1>

      {/* Ta-dah! The inferred type from the `listAccounts` function matches the expected type defined explicitly in the <AccountListTable /> */}
      <AccountListTable accountList={accountList} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

`zod` (and other similar tools, like [valibot](https://valibot.dev)) provide a
protective layer against unexpected data shapes in TypeScript applications,
improving the predictability and reliability of application code, all while
avoiding the "trust me, bro" mistakes that are common when handling data
fetching.
