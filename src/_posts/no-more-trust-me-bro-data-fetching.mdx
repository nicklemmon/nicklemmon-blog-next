TypeScript (and other static analysis tools) can help prevent a whole category
of defects, ensuring data flows smoothly and predictably throughout an
application. When used insufficiently, however, TypeScript does not offer this
protection &mdash; rather, application teams need to invest in adequate type
safety, particularly when fetching data.

## “Trust me, bro” data fetching

When fetching data, the JSON response is never typed by default, as the inferred
type of a typical fetching function is `Promise<any>`:

```ts
async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

  return await res.json() // The inferred return type is `Promise<any>`
}
```

In typical applications, this problem is solved by casting the resolved response
using `as` &mdash; when `as` is used, this is a "trust me, bro" moment. Don't
worry about the response type—'Trust me, bro,' it's _exactly_ what I say it is.
No need to check.

```ts
type Account = {
  id: string
  name: string
  holdings: number
}

async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

  return (await res.json()) as Array<Account>
}
```

Even fully fledged, popular frontend frameworks (like Angular), who expose a
service for data fetching (see the
[HttpClient documentation for more](https://angular.dev/guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data)),
still handle data typing via the "trust me, bro" strategy out of the box:

```ts
// This isn't using `as`, but a generic - the end result is the same - the shape of the data is not validated at runtime but is assumed!
// "Trust me, bro! The account list is *always* in the right shape!"
http.get<Array<Account>>('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')
```

Unfortunately, this leaves a lot to be desired. If the shape of the API response
ever changes _or_ if the type definition of `Account` is inaccurate, any
application logic that assumes the return type of `listAccounts()` is
`Array<Account>` can _never_ be trusted. Even though TypeScript is used in the
data fetching function, runtime errors can still occur unpredictably over time.

## Actually type safe (and predictable) data fetching

Instead of blindly assuming that your data is shaped in a certain way, it is
best to first validate that data, typically using a schema validation library
like [zod](https://zod.dev/) or [valibot](https://valibot.dev/).

Let's re-write our `listAccounts` function using a Zod schema:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  holdings: z.number(),
})

async function listAccounts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.nicklemmon.com/accounts/list')

  try {
    if (!res.ok) throw Error('Account fetching failed!')

    // We `.parse` the awaited JSON response to ensure its in the right shape,
    // and catch any errors that might result. With a monitoring service in place,
    // we could flag type runtime errors more cleanly for fixing by API teams.
    const json = AccountSchema.parse(await res.json())

    return json // The inferred return type will match the shape of the `AccountSchema`
  } catch (err) {
    throw Error(String(err))
  }
}
```

The `AccountSchema` looks awfully similar to TypeScript, but with a few extra
lines we can have both a schema definition which can handle validation at
runtime _and_ a type definition at build time which are inherently linked:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

// Runtime schema
const AccountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  holdings: z.number(),
})

// Build time type definition
type Account = z.infer<typeof AccountSchema>
```

Now we have type safe data fetching with type definitions and runtime type
validation &mdash; all of which are tightly coupled to produce predictable
results.

## Schema and type usage in the UI layer

Now that we have a defined type, our UI can fetch data, and then render the
result predictably. This example uses
[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) and React to help
orchestrate fetching and rendering.

First, we define our route. We can import our `listAccounts` function and use it
in the route definition:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { listAccounts } from '../api'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/accounts/$list')({
  component: RouteComponent,
  loader: async () => {
    // Remember, this function validates the shape of the data
    // or throws an error if the data is in an unexpected shape
    return await listAccounts()
  },
})

function RouteComponent() {
  // The account list is made available through the baked-in `useLoaderData` hook
  const accountList = Route.useLoaderData()

  return <h1>List of accounts</h1>
}
```

We can define an `<AccountListTable />` component, which anticipates an account
list as a prop:

```tsx
import type { Account } from '../api'

function AccountListTable({ accountList }: { accountList: Array<Account> }) {
  return (
    <table>{/* Logic for rendering the account list table goes here */}</table>
  )
}
```

When can then render the `<AccountListTable />` in our accounts list route,
achieving end-to-end type safety, without relying to "trust me, bro" TypeScript
techniques:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { listAccounts } from '../api.ts'
import { AccountListTable } from '../account-list-table.tsx'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/accounts/$list')({
  component: RouteComponent,
  loader: async () => {
    // Remember, this function validates the shape of the data
    // or throws an error if the data is in an unexpected shape
    return await listAccounts()
  },
})

function RouteComponent() {
  // The account list is made available through the baked-in `useLoaderData` hook
  const accountList = Route.useLoaderData()

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>List of accounts</h1>

      {/* Ta-dah! The inferred type from the `listAccounts` function matches the expected type defined explicitly in the <AccountListTable /> */}
      <AccountListTable accountList={accountList} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

`zod` (and other similar tools, like [valibot](https://valibot.dev)) provide a
protective layer against unexpected data shapes in TypeScript applications,
improving the predictability and reliability of your application code, all while
avoiding the "trust me, bro" mistakes that are common when handling data
fetching.

This is the first in a series of articles about building predictable, type-safe
data fetching in TypeScript applications. Next, I'll cover how to pair our
runtime schema validation with data mocking to write automated integration
tests—without the flakiness typical of other approaches..
