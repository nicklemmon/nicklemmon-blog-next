## The problem

Design systems and packaged icon components often ship pre-built and branded
icon sets. These icon sets ideally ship with the design system code library,
without requiring significant setup on the part of application engineers.

Techniques for implementing icon systems are limited when it comes to NPM
packages, thanks to distinct requirements:

1. The icon set **must work across all devices and screen densities**
1. The icon set **must be cache-able**
1. Application engineers should be able to **add to the existing icon set**
   using icons specific to their application
1. The icon set **must respond to design system tokens** (i.e., colors) and
   properly handle light and dark mode
1. Application engineers should be able to **apply ARIA attributes** for icons
   that convey meaning and icons that are purely decorative
1. **Offer a simple API for developers**

## Running the requirements gauntlet

Let's dive right in to each requirement, and come up with a coherent, pragmatic
solution:

### 1. Work across all devices and screen densities

### 2. Efficient, cache-able icon sets

### 3. Allowing for customization

### 4. Responding to design tokens

### 5. Support for ARIA attributes

### 6. Simple API
