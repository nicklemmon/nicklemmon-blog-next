[HTML headings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)
are not semantically complex elements though they are frequently used
inappropriately by both designers and engineers alike.

## Why Use Headings?

Each heading can be specificied with a level (1 through 6) and render text
content to the DOM. Generally, headings are used to group content in a
hierarchical fashion, much like a newspaper or magazine article.

```html
<h1>Man Lands on the Moon!</h1>

<h2>Who Landed?</h2>

<h3>The First Man on the Moon</h3>

<p>Neal Armstrong!</p>

<h3>The Rest</h3>

<p>Buzz Aldrin was also there!</p>

<h2>Were There Aliens?</h2>

<p>Sadly, no.</p>
```

In a traditional document layout, heading levels correspond naturally with the
flow of content. This document flow helps users quickly scan for content
visually and helps screen reader users navigate quickly around a page. WebAIM
wrote a
[great article on the subject](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/#headings).

## Common Pitfalls

Both visual designers and developers make some common mistakes when using
headings in their work, largely stemming from the typical connection between
style and semantic meaning.

For better or for worse, modern web applications do not tend to contain long
blocks of structured content, making maintaining a strict heading hierachy more
difficult. Visual designers may, for example, hope to use a heading that _looks
like_ a level 5 heading when, according to the document hierarchy, a level 2
heading might be more appropriate.

Similarly, developers will often (inappropriately) leverage headings as a means
of styling. Without enough knowledge of the importance of the heading hierarchy
of a document, an engineer may reach for an `<h6 />` when a `<p />` with bold
styling was needed.

## Abstraction to the Rescue

Fortunately, building a re-usable `Heading` component abstraction can help
separate the visual presentation from the semantic meaning of a heading instance
without relying on manual, one-off styling.

### Styling

First, let's apply some styling to headings globally that will apply directly to
HTML elements. Generally, styling HTML elements globally should be avoided,
however, styling headings in this manner can help ensure authored content
(possibly provided via a CMS) renders with the relevant hierarchical
presentation.

Take the following CSS, for example, with font size values generated from
[modularscale.com](https://modularscale.com):

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  font-weight: 700;
  font-family: serif;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.986rem;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.488rem;
}

h3 {
  font-size: 2.074rem;
}

h4 {
  font-size: 1.728rem;
}

h5 {
  font-size: 1.44rem;
}

h6 {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

### Providing Semantic Control

With styling handled, now we need a re-usable way to generate the heading level
from a single component:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './heading-styles.css'

function Heading({ as, children }) {
  const Component = as

  return <Component>{children}</Component>
}

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Heading as="h1">My Page</Heading>

      <Heading as="h2">More Information</Heading>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Separate Form from function

With the DOM rendering handled, now we incorporate a new prop `looksLike` that
helps divorce presentation from the underlying semantics. In this example, we
leverage the
[ARIA heading role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/heading_role)
paired with the `aria-level` attribute in order to have more granular control
over the DOM semantically:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import './heading-styles.css'

function Heading({ as, looksLike, children }) {
  const Component = looksLike ? looksLike : as
  const headingLevel = as.replace('h', '')

  return (
    <Component role="heading" aria-level={headingLevel}>
      {children}
    </Component>
  )
}

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Heading as="h1">My Page</Heading>

      <Heading as="h2" looksLike="h3">
        More Information
      </Heading>
    </>
  )
}
```

Now, the "More Information" heading _looks_ like a level 3 heading, but is
semantically a level 2 heading.

## Conclusion

Building a re-usable, accessible component abstraction can help improve the
developer experience of a project while also improving the end-user experience.
Spending a little time to introduce such an abstraction can pay off in the long
run, allowing for easier feature development, all while lowering the risk of
accessibility defects.
