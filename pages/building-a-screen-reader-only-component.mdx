import Demo from 'components/Demo'
import ScreenReaderOnly from 'components/ScreenReaderOnly'

When building sites or applications, users encounter elements that require
accessible names, however, do not have them by default. There are several
different means by which to add names that only screen reader users can access,
however, one of the most simple is a reusable, composable, `<ScreenReaderOnly/>`
component.

## Use Cases

A common use case for such a component, is a `<button />` that visually contains
an icon and no visible text content. In the following example, we'll render a
`<HamburgerButton/>` component with an icon imported from
[React Icons Kit](https://react-icons-kit.now.sh/):

<Demo>
  <button style={{ border: 0, padding: '20px', borderRadius: '50%' }}>
    <Icon icon={menu} />
  </button>
</Demo>

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Icon } from 'react-icons-kit'
import { menu } from 'react-icons-kit/iconic/menu'

const styles = {
  border: 0,
  outline: 0,
  padding: '20px',
  borderRadius: '50%',
}

function HamburgerButton({ onClick }) {
  return (
    <button style={styles} onClick={onClick}>
      <Icon icon={menu} />
    </button>
  )
}
```

Visually, I can interpret the button as some sort of a menu, as I am aware of
the common pattern of using three bars to represent navigation-related buttons.
Unfortunately, for users who are unable to see the icon visually, the button is
unnamed, and thus, it becomes impossible to determine its purpose.

We **could** add visible content next to the icon, solving the problem. Though
this functionally resolves the issue, creating an experience without the content
visually rendered is still possible.

## A Simple Solution

A flexible `<ScreenReaderOnly/>` or `<VisuallyHidden/>` component can resolve
this problem, and help address similar situations in the future. Our component
needs to do two things:

1. It must render content to the DOM that a screen reader can interpret and
2. said content must not be visible to non-screen reader users.

### Rendering Content

First, let's just build a simple component that renders a `<span/>` with any
passed in children:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function ScreenReaderOnly({ children }) {
  return <span>{children}</span>
}
```

### Hiding the Content

Next, let's hide the content. This can be accomplished with a series of CSS
properties in conjunction with one another. Since other developers have done the
legwork, let's put ourselves on the shoulders of giants to give us a head start.
Take this example from
[Gaël Poupard on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/ffoodd/000b59f431e3e64e4ce1a24d5bb36034).

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const styles = {
	border: 0 !important;
	clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
	-webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
		clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
	height: 1px !important;
	margin: -1px !important;
	overflow: hidden !important;
	padding: 0 !important;
	position: absolute !important;
	width: 1px !important;
	white-space: nowrap !important;
}

function ScreenReaderOnly({ children }) {
  return <span style={styles}>{children}</span>
}
```

Now, we add the component to our `<HamburgerButton/>` with the content "Menu",
and the rendered `<button/>` has an invisible (yet accessible) name:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Icon } from 'react-icons-kit'
import { menu } from 'react-icons-kit/iconic/menu'
import { ScreenReaderOnly } from 'src/components'

const styles = {
  border: 0,
  padding: '20px',
  borderRadius: '50%',
}

function HamburgerButton({ onClick }) {
  return (
    <button style={styles} onClick={onClick}>
      <Icon icon={menu} />

      <ScreenReaderOnly>Menu</ScreenReaderOnly>
    </button>
  )
}
```

<Demo>
  <button style={{ border: 0, padding: '20px', borderRadius: '50%' }}>
    <Icon icon={menu} />
    <ScreenReaderOnly>Menu</ScreenReaderOnly>
  </button>
</Demo>

All done! Right?

### Going the Extra Mile

We can make our component more robust, by adding an `as` prop (a la
[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)):

```jsx
...

function ScreenReaderOnly({ as = 'span', children }) {
  const Component = as;

  return <Component style={styles}>{children}</Component>
}
```

By adding support for `as`, a developer can pass in any valid HTML element _or_
React component, and make it visually hidden. This can be particularly helpful
when the order of elements is important for semantics, especially when adding
extra wrapping `<div>` or `<span>` elements might introduce problems. Let's take
a `<fieldset/>` with a visually hidden `<legend/>`, for example:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ScreenReaderOnly } from 'src/components'

function MyRadioGroup({ title, children }) {
  return (
    <fieldset>
      <ScreenReaderOnly as="legend">Favorite Ice Cream Flavor</ScreenReaderOnly>

      <label htmlFor="radio-button-chocolate">
        <input
          type="radio"
          id="radio-button-chocolate"
          name="favoriteFlavor"
          value="chocolate"
        />
        Chocolate is my favorite ice cream flavor
      </label>

      <label htmlFor="radio-button-vanilla">
        <input
          type="radio"
          id="radio-button-vanilla"
          name="favoriteFlavor"
          value="vanilla"
        />
        Vanilla is my favorite ice cream flavor
      </label>

      <label htmlFor="radio-button-strawberry">
        <input
          type="radio"
          id="radio-button-strawberry"
          name="favoriteFlavor"
          value="strawberry"
        />
        Strawberry is my favorite ice cream flavor
      </label>
    </fieldset>
  )
}
```

In order for this component to have valid HTML, the `<legend/>` is supposed to
be the first, immediate child of the `<fieldset/>`. By adding the `as` prop to
the `<ScreenReaderOnly/>` component, we are able to both write valid HTML, and
create the visual design and user experience we were hoping for.

## Wrapping Up

Creating this component is the easy part! Knowing when to use it, is a much more
involved endeavor.
